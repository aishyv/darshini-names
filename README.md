# What's in a name? A whole category of restaurants

## Analysis of the names of darshini-type restaurants in Bangalore

This is my submission for the 2023 Lede Program's second project. 

#### Goal
Inspired by [The Pudding's piece on pub names](https://pudding.cool/2019/10/pubs/) in the UK, I wanted to recreate the analysis for the names of a particular type of fast-food restaurant in Bangalore. In my 7 years of living here, I intuitively knew that they all have similar-sounding names - I wanted to test this hunch and find a pattern of naming. I intended for it to be simple and visual.

### Data collection
My dataset was sourced from Kaggle/

### Data Analysis:

### New skills, approaches
- figma 2 html (!!)
- Adding footer, favicon to the page
- a simple mapbox map

### What I tried to do (struggles)
I tried to keep it simple on data collection and heavy on data viz and CSS. HOWEVER, since I chose to do my viz through figma2html I failed terribly in the execution. I wasn't able to nail the charts changing with the aspect ratio - and had to manually go in and edit lines and lines of code that didn't pick up the CSS style I had set for font. I also tried to include maps - to show which type of names are where. But I ran out of time. 

### What I wanted to do, will probably do the next time
~Start the next project immediately?~ Pay for AI or use Datawrapper/RAWgraphs for viz. Something more map heavy? Focus more on analysis and viz. MORE CSS
